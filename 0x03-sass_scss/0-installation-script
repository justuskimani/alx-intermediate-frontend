# Steps I Took to Install SASS

1. **Checked if Node.js and npm were installed**
   - I opened my terminal and ran:
     ```bash
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```
   - If not installed, I downloaded Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

2. **Installed Sass globally using npm**
   ```bash
   npm install -g sass

3. Confirmed Sass installation

sass --version

This showed the version number, meaning Sass was installed correctly.



4. Created a test SCSS file and compiled it

Example SCSS file:

$primary-color: blue;

body {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}

I compiled it to CSS using:

sass style.scss style.css



5. Used the --watch option to auto-compile on save

sass --watch style.scss:style.css
